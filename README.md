# drfront-responsive    
     
This little SASS-project fixes the none-responsive stylesheets that comes with Dr.Front.    
The css has no dependencies, but should only be deployed on top of the already generated code from Dr.Front.   
      
      
## Installation   
```
npm install drfront-responsive --save
```    
     
## Usage    
Include `node_modules/drfront-responsive/src/sass/` as a path to your sass-build.   
Then you should create your own settings file for the drfront-responsive settings.   
This can be copied from `node_modules/drfront-responsive/src/sass/settings/_settings.scss`    
Then import the settings file you created and the drfrontresponsive.scss file into your main sass file.    
```
@import "<the-name-you-have-the-config-file";
@import "drfront-responsive"
```

You now have a mixin called drfrontresponsive() ready for use in your stylesheet.   
This can be included just simply as:
```
@include drfront-responsive()
```     
    
If the default settings are correct for your dr.front setup, then there are two prebuilt css file in `node_modules/dist/css/` , one minified and one not.   
These can be included just like any other stylesheet, after the drfront css.
